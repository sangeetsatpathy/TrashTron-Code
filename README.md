detect_bottles.py: the final program used on the robot
test_all_motors.py: A program I used to test the integration between the two different types of the motors I was using on the robot: the Dynamixel MX motors and the Dynamixel XC330 motors.

Reverse-Kinematic-Code.py: code that I wrote while learning about forward kinematics. This code makes a robotic linkage go to a precise (x, y) position based on my Tkinter GUI inputs.
Phidget_RCServo_Code.py: learnt how to use the Phidget servos when I was still deciding on what motors to use on the robot.
Light_Code.py: coded when I was learning how to use Phidgets. This program toggles the Light Phidget based on the input from the Joystick Phidget.
